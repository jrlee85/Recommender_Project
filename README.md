# Recommender_Project

**Content-based filtering movie recommender**

Personal project based on the Movie Database 5000 Movie Dataset from Kaggle.

In this project, I built a movie recommender using a content-based filtering approach. I measured the cosine similarity between movies based on text features for each movie. I converted the text to vectors using both a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency approach and a Bag of Words approach.
